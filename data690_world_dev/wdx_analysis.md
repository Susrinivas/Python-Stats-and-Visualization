## What is the importance of science of technology in overall development of country ?
Lets discuss some basic points, USA is now world power because of technology, China is rising power because of technology, all western countries plays key role in world economic progress, because of technology, developing technology is not just a single year acheivement, Governments should make good policies to spend minimum amount of GDP on Reseach and development wing, they should concentrate of increaing literacy rate, reducing poverty, in my view countrys overall development is well calculated by the use of techology

### Here I am discussing about the science and tehnology sector in BRICS countries

China is the leading country in using science and technology followed by russia and india, but how its possible for china to become main player in exporting technology goods by using science and technology

#### Here is the bar chart which depicts the above point

![Bar chart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79036336/198520508-3354523d-18c4-4d9d-b55f-7c3364bba430.png)


China exports are over a whooping 700 billion dollars in year 2020, even no country other than china is able to export to this quantity, and next comes india with around 50 billion dollars, but india has almost equal population as china, but how china is able to achieve success in this field, if you look back at 1990, india and china have equal resources, china communist party started implementing new economic polices and reforms which leads to present china where india lacks at bringing policies at right time 
So atleast governments should start enforcing new polices by taking china as an example

#### pie chart which shows technology goods exporting countries 

![Pie chart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79036336/198520968-aec2e794-6004-49f2-a4dc-5978da0c7531.png)

The above pie chart have same data as bar chart, as you seen 95% of technology exports come from china in brics nations, ofcourse in military equipment Russia is the leading exporter

#### Chart which shows historic data
![line chart](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79036336/198523558-e9e493f6-ea9e-4626-ad92-1ef625c8e3bd.png)

if you look at the above graph which depicts the historic trend shows that from 2007 china is like a f1 race car which has steep rise apart from some sudden breaks (ups and downs), and india is like a car moving with uniform speed, india and other nations should really concentrate on their policies

 #### Graph representingTechnicians in R&D vs exports ($ US)

![scatter plot_1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79036336/198525959-d0cc056e-761f-4331-9c10-842f064dc4de.png)

if you see above graph, before pandemic Czechia has highest number of technicians per million (2,186) with exports of 36 billion dollars with only 1 crore people, its like a small city and hong kong has exports of 330 billion dollars with only 315 technicians per million. Korea has 190 billion dollars of exports with 1,311 people per million, with increase in research and development expenditure there is increase in technology manufacturing and exports too with population into consideration.

so as you see highly developed countries are those which spend much percentage of gdp on science and technology sector, Devoloping and underdeveloped countries should strictly start spending atleast 5% of budget on resreach and development with fair share given to education as well, which will ultimately traqnsform its future into a golden era with correct policies and government vigilance

Above graph tells same as the previous one expect that this graph shows relationship between % of GDP spent vs exports, its clear from the above graph with % of GDP spent there are more exports considering population, as you see Israel spent almost 4.5% of GDP on R&D, but it has only exports of around 50 billion dollars, but you know its population is only 9 million, so with small nation it has capability of giving its max share in exports due to the expenditure on GDP, Countries like india should start studying the policies set by Korea, Israel and china to make them as a self sustained countries with out having trade deficit because of higher imports than exports, India is now transforming its future in right direction and it will take couple of decades to become a key player as china in science and technology sector.
